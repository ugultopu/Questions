What is the point of type casting? Why is it even a language feature?
=====================================================================
Should it ever be used? My guess is not. When you think that you need type casting, creating an instance of the destination type by giving the source type instance as an argument to the destination type constructor makes much more sense IMHO. Then what is even the point of type casting? Should it ever be used?
